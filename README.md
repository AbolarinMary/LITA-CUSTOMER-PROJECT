Methodology

 - Data Collection

   I gatherered historical sales data, including both regional and product-specific data from LITA.The data ensured data consistency across regions and product categories, covering key metrics such as units sold, pricing, and revenue generated.

 - Data Preprocessing

  I  Cleansed and structure the data, handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This ensures that the data is ready for deep analysis and provides reliable insights.

- Descriptive Analysis

 I Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize key statistics, visualize trends, and identify correlations between regional performance and product sales. This includes regional sales heatmaps, product-specific trend charts, and performance comparisons across region during the period in view .
 

 -  Visualization & Reporting

   Present findings using interactive dashboards and detailed reports, showcasing regional and product-specific sales performance and trend graphs.
  Power BI and excel charts was used   to ensure stakeholders can easily interpret the data.
