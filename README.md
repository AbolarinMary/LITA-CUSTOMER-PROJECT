# LITA-CUSTOMER-PROJECT

**Summary**

This project outlines a comprehensive approach to analyzing customer data for a subscription service. Here’s a detailed plan for each phase of the project, from Excel analysis to SQL queries and Power BI visualization.


**Project Objectives**


Analyze customer data to identify patterns in subscription usage and preferences.

Assess how different demographics (e.g., age, region) affect subscription choices and behavior

Classify customers into meaningful segments based on subscription type, duration, and behavior.

Identify high-value segments for targeted marketing and retention strategies.

Determine which subscription types are most popular among customers.

Compute average subscription duration to understand customer loyalty.

Track renewal rates and identify factors that contribute to customer retention


**These objectives aim to enhance understanding of customer dynamics within the subscription service, ultimately leading to better strategies for customer acquisition, retention, and revenue growth.

1. Excel Analysis
Pivot Tables:

Create pivot tables to analyze:
Subscription types and their counts.
Customer distribution by region.
Cancellations over time.
Calculating Average Subscription Duration:

Use the formula:
Average Subscription Duration
=
Total Subscription Duration
Number of Customers
Average Subscription Duration= 
Number of Customers
Total Subscription Duration
​
 
Analyze subscription duration across different types.
Identifying Popular Subscription Types:

Use a pivot table to count the frequency of each subscription type.
Highlight the top three most popular subscription types.
Additional Reports:

Trend analysis of subscription sign-ups and cancellations over time.
Comparison of revenue generated by different subscription types.
2. SQL Queries
Once the dataset is loaded into SQL Server, you can run the following queries:

Total Number of Customers by Region:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Region;
Most Popular Subscription Type:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS CustomerCount
FROM Customers
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY CustomerCount DESC
LIMIT 1;
Customers Who Canceled Within 6 Months:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE CancellationDate IS NOT NULL AND DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStartDate, CancellationDate) <= 6;
Average Subscription Duration:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStartDate, SubscriptionEndDate)) AS AverageDuration
FROM Customers;
Customers with Subscriptions Longer than 12 Months:

sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStartDate, SubscriptionEndDate) > 12;
Total Revenue by Subscription Type:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM Customers
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;
Top 3 Regions by Subscription Cancellations:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Cancellations
FROM Customers
WHERE CancellationDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellations DESC
LIMIT 3;
Total Number of Active and Canceled Subscriptions:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CancellationDate IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS ActiveSubscriptions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN CancellationDate IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS CanceledSubscriptions
FROM Customers;
3. Power BI Dashboard
Dashboard Elements:

Visualize customer segments using bar charts for regions and subscription types.
Line charts to show trends in cancellations and renewals over time.
Slicers for interactive filtering by region, subscription type, and time period.
Key Visualizations:

Total active vs. canceled subscriptions.
Revenue breakdown by subscription type.
Number of customers by subscription type and region.
Interactive Features:

Implement slicers for:
Time periods (monthly, quarterly).
Subscription types.
Regions to allow users to drill down into specific data.
GitHub Repository
Create a repository to house:
Excel files with pivot tables and reports.
SQL scripts for queries.
Power BI project file (.pbix) for the dashboard.
Documentation on project methodology and findings.
Final Deliverables
An organized repository on GitHub with all analysis files.
A well-structured Power BI dashboard that provides insights into customer behavior, cancellations, and subscriptions.
